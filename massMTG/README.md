# Mass MTG

Using Mass MTG you can input many cards names using an 'input.txt' in the same folder mtgPricePull.py and it will ouput a prices.csv file with the card names, set, price, and foil price of the lowest price version of the cards.

To run you need to install scrypy.py from https://github.com/Lester822/scryPy. This Scryfall Python Wrapper developed by me.

Simply put the card names in inputs.txt, run the program and get your output.
